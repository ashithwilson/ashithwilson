<p>I'm <b>Ashith 👋</b></p>
<p>
An Engineer by profession presently working on some awesome stuff at Cloudera. I wear many hats depending on what is required of me. That said, I'm first and foremost, a passionate learner, an site reliability engineer, and a DevOps enthusiast!

I would be really happy to help with anything related to tech. So, feel free to reach out to me to talk about possible opportunities, mentorship, collaborations and everything in between! I also speak at colleges and technical conferences. I'm just an invite away.
